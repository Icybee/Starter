# Starter kit

This is the starter kit for the [Icybee](http://icybee.org/) CMS. This package
provides you with a basic installation, a very good start to create your
website.

Before you continue note that at the moment the default template is VERY basic, please don't
be disappointed, Icybee can do great things!





## Requirements

PHP 5.3 or later is required.





## Installation

The following steps describe how to setup a basic Icybee installation. Note that the installation
process requires [composer](http://getcomposer.org/), it will be automatically downloaded to
fetch the required dependencies. You can take a look at the `composer.json` file to check
the additional packages that are installed along Icybee.





### Cloning the repository 

First you need to clone starter kit repository [available on GitHub](https://github.com/Icybee/Starter).
Use the following lines, and don't forget to change `<project_name>` to your project name:

	$ git clone git://github.com/Icybee/Starter.git <project_name>
	$ cd <project_name>





### Installing the dependencies

Now that the repository is cloned and that we are at its root, you just need to type `make`.
Composer will be installed and all the dependencies fetched.





### Installing Icybee

To install Icybee use your favorite browser (except IE < 9, but IE8 can't be your favorite browser)
and navigate to the domain that you have setup for your project e.g. http://icybee.localhost

The installer will guide you step by step, checking requirements and giving you advice if they
are not met. Within 3 minutes you'll be logged into Icybee, ready to create your first website.
